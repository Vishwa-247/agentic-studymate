# Studymate - Agentic Career Platform

> **Status:** MVP Implementation / Redesign Phase
> **Target:** Production-Grade Agentic Learning Platform (Lovable)

## Current Project (What's Here Now)

This repository currently contains the **Core Foundation and UI/UX Architecture** for Studymate. It is a functional MVP designed with a premium SaaS aesthetic.

### ✅ Built Features
- **Modern SaaS UI:** Redesigned Landing Page, Auth flow, and Dashboard inspired by high-end engineering tools.
- **Interactive Demos:** Built-in simulations for `System Flow`, `Terminal Interviews`, `DSA Visualizers`, and `Project Studio`.
- **Learning Infrastructure:**
  - **DSASheet:** Topic-wise tracking for algorithms.
  - **Mock Interviews:** Interface for AI-driven interview simulation.
  - **Course Generator:** Structure for dynamic, scenario-based learning.
  - **Resume Analyzer:** Module for profile evaluation.
- **Unified Branding:** Consistent branding with the "Studymate" identity and custom Brain logo.

## The Vision (What We Are Making)

We are pushing this to Lovable to transform these interactive components into a **fully agentic ecosystem**. We are moving away from "passive content" to "production-grade thinking."

### 🚀 Future Roadmap
1. **Agent Orchestrator (The Brain):** Implementing the central logic that tracks user weaknesses and *controls* the learning path, rather than just offering a list.
2. **True Interactive Course Generation:** Lessons that don't just show text, but force users to make architectual decisions and handle "failure injections."
3. **Multi-Agent Project Studio:** Turning the demo into a real workflow where a team of AI agents (Idea Analyst, System Design, UI/UX) collaborate with the user.
4. **Production-Logic Interviews:** Moving beyond simple Q&A to simulations that test clarification habits, scale awareness, and adaptability.
5. **Real-time Feedback Loop:** Adaptive career state updates that replan the user's next action based on every interaction.
